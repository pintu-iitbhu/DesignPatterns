# Visitor Design Pattern
The **Visitor Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms (or operations) from the objects on which they operate. It enables you to define new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which the operations are performed.

# Key Concepts:
1. **Visitor Interface**: Declares a set of visit methods for each type of element in the object structure.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the visitor interface, providing specific implementations for the operations on different types of elements.
3. **Element Interface**: Declares an accept method that accepts a visitor object, allowing the visitor to perform an operation on the element.
4. **Concrete Elements**: These are the objects that will be visited. Each concrete element class implements the accept method.
5. **Object Structure**: A collection or hierarchy of elements, allowing the visitor to traverse them and perform operations.

# Benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: The pattern separates the operations (algorithms) from the object structure.
- **Open/Closed Principle** : You can add new operations by introducing new visitors without changing the existing element classes.
- **Extensibility**: The pattern is especially useful when you need to perform different kinds of operations on a set of objects that belong to different classes.
